<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And Job spake, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">But Job answered and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Job answered and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
<VERS vnumber="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="33">
<VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
<VERS vnumber="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
<VERS vnumber="1">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
<VERS vnumber="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
<VERS vnumber="1">At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
<VERS vnumber="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="42">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So Job died, being old and full of days.</VERS>

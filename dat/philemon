<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<CAPTION vref="1">Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.</CAPTION>
<VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </VERS>
